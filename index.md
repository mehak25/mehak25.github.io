#### About Me
I am a PhD Graduate from the department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. 
I did my doctoral research at the <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/healthylaife/"><i>Healthy lAIfe Lab</i></a>, under the advisement of Prof. Rahmatollah Beheshti.
I work in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its interdisciplinary applications in healthcare. 

I will be starting as Assistant Professor at Southern Methodist University in Fall 2023.
