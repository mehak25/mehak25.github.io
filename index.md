#### About Me
I am a PhD Candidate in the department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/healthylaife/"><i>Healthy lAIfe Lab</i></a>, under the advisement of Prof. Rahmatollah Beheshti.
I work in the area of Machine Learning and Health Data Science. 
As a PhD candidate in Computer Science, I work on advanced machine learning problems with clear implications on individualsâ€™ health. 
My research interest is in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its interdisciplinary applications in healthcare. Within AI, I am interested in problems related to natural language processing, representation learning, predictive modeling with supervised and semi-supervised deep learning models. 
I am also interested in improving the fairness and explainability of AI systems to enhance their usability and adaptability.
